# AI & ML Algorithms and Techniques

This repository contains my work, notes, and projects from the **AI and Machine Learning Algorithms and Techniques** course, part of the **Microsoft AI & ML Certification**.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview
In this course, I am exploring core concepts and practical implementations of:
- **Supervised Learning** â€“ Training models using labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).
- **Unsupervised Learning** â€“ Discovering patterns and structures from unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
- **Reinforcement Learning** â€“ Teaching agents to make sequential decisions via rewards and penalties.
- **Deep Learning** â€“ Building and training neural networks for complex tasks such as image recognition and NLP.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
